Certainly! Here is an example of how to sort a list in increasing order using Python's built-in sort() method:

```python
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]

lst.sort()

print(lst)
```

Output:
```
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

In this example, we first declare a list `lst` with some elements. We then use the `sort()` method to sort the list in-place in increasing order. Finally, we print the sorted list.
